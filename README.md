# Problem Solver

Problem Solver is a Flutter-based application that uses AI to help solve questions captured via photographs. The application sends the images to an API, which processes them and returns solutions. The API can be found at the [ProblemSolverAPI repository](https://github.com/Denizozaltay/ProblemSolverAPI).
